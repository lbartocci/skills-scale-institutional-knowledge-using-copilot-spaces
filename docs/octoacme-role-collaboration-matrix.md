## Best Practices for Role Collaboration

1. **Clear Ownership**: Each activity has a clearly designated owner
2. **Defined Handoffs**: Explicit handoff points between roles (e.g., requirements → development → testing)
3. **Regular Touchpoints**: Scheduled sync meetings prevent misalignment
4. **Shared Context**: All roles have access to project documentation and status
5. **Escalation Paths**: Clear escalation routes when collaboration breaks down
6. **Feedback Loops**: Regular retrospectives to improve collaboration patterns
