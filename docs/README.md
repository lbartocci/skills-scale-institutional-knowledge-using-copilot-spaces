# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Documentation hub. This collection of guides provides a comprehensive framework for managing projects at OctoAcme, from initial concept through delivery and continuous improvement.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management approach is built on structured workflows, clear role definitions, and consistent communication practices. Our processes emphasize:

- **Iterative Delivery**: We deliver small, testable increments that enable rapid feedback and adaptation
- **Clear Ownership**: Every project has designated Project Managers and Product Leads who drive execution and outcomes
- **Customer-First Focus**: All decisions prioritize customer value and usability
- **Multidisciplinary Collaboration**: Developers, Product Managers, Project Managers, QA, and stakeholders work together throughout the project lifecycle
- **Data-Informed Decisions**: We measure impact and iterate based on evidence and metrics
- **Quality Assurance**: Integrated testing, code reviews, and security scanning ensure high-quality deliverables
- **Psychological Safety**: We encourage open feedback, learning from failures, and continuous improvement

## Key Workflows

Our project lifecycle follows five core phases:

1. **Initiation**: Validate business needs, identify stakeholders, and define success criteria
2. **Planning**: Break work into shippable increments, estimate effort, and create release plans
3. **Execution**: Build, test, and iterate with regular standups and demos
4. **Release**: Deploy to production with proper verification and stakeholder communication
5. **Retrospective**: Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements

## Communication Cadence

Consistent communication keeps teams aligned and projects on track:

- **Daily Standups**: 15-minute sync focused on progress, blockers, and dependencies
- **Weekly PM + PdM Sync**: Alignment on priorities, risks, and decisions
- **Twice-Weekly Team Standups**: Delivery team coordination (or as agreed)
- **Sprint Demos/Reviews**: Showcase progress at the end of each sprint or milestone
- **Monthly Stakeholder Updates**: High-level progress and strategic alignment
- **Ad-hoc Escalations**: As needed for critical issues or blockers

## How to Use These Documents

### For New Team Members
Start with the [Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md) to understand our approach, then explore the [Personas and Roles](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) guide to understand your responsibilities.

### For Project Managers
Use the full lifecycle guides from [Initiation](octoacme-project-initiation.md) through [Retrospective](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md) as templates and checklists for your projects.

### For Product Managers
Focus on the [Planning](octoacme-project-planning.md), [Execution & Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md), and [Risk Management & Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md) guides to align with delivery teams.

### For Developers
Review the [Execution & Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md) and [Release & Deployment Guide](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md) to understand workflows, quality standards, and deployment processes.

### For Copilot Spaces Integration
These documents serve as institutional knowledge for OctoAcme. Add relevant process-specific documentation to your project's `.copilot/` directory so that GitHub Copilot Spaces can use them as context when providing assistance. Keep the Project Charter and other key artifacts updated in your project repository for consistent team alignment.

## Repository Context

This documentation is part of the OctoAcme institutional knowledge base, designed to:

- Standardize project management practices across all teams
- Reduce onboarding time for new team members
- Provide reusable templates and checklists
- Enable AI-assisted development through GitHub Copilot Spaces
- Support continuous process improvement

All OctoAcme projects should reference these documents and adapt them as needed for specific project contexts. Updates to these guides should be proposed through the standard contribution process.
